Data information:

- ID number 
- Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 

and we have ten real-valued features which are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
- perimeter 
- area 
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
- symmetry 
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

We also have mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of the above features for each example.
